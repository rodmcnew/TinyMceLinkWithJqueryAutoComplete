TinyMCE Link Plugin with jQuery Autocomplete
=================================

This is a hacked copy of the tinyMCE link plugin. The "Link List" select box
has been replaced by a jQuery-ui auto-complete menu on the url text box so
you can just start typing rather than scrolling through the "link list"
select box.

You must have jQuery-ui installed and included for this to work.

Provide your link list data to tiny mce in the standard way in config
