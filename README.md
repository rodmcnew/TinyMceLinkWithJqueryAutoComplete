TinyMCE Link Plugin with jQuery Autocomplete
=================================

This is a hacked copy of the TinyMCE link plugin. The "link list" select box
has been replaced by a jQuery-ui auto-complete menu on the url text box so
you can just start typing rather than scrolling through the "link list"
select box.

You must have jQuery-ui installed and included for this to work.

Provide your link list data to TinyMCE in the standard way in config.

These changes were made by Rod McNew. Rod Mcnew's changes to this file are
free for anyone to use for anything they want. Please check the licensing
details on the original tiny-mce file as well.
