TinyMceLinkWithJqueryAutoComplete
=================================

This is a hacked copy of the tinyMCE link plugin. The "Link List" select box has been replaced by a jQuery-ui auto-complete menu on the url text box so  you can just start typing rather than scrolling through the "link list"  select box.
